## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get your local development environment running.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osumba404/digital-leap-africa.git
cd digital-leap-africa
```

---

### 2. Backend Setup (Laravel)

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend

# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Create your environment file from the example
cp .env.example .env

# Generate a new application key
php artisan key:generate

# Configure your DB_DATABASE, DB_USERNAME, and DB_PASSWORD in the .env file.
# Make sure you have created a database named 'dla'.

# Run migrations and seed the database with initial data (including the admin user)
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed
```

> This will set up all necessary tables and create a default admin user.

---

### 3. Frontend Setup (React)

```bash
# Navigate to the React app directory from the project root
cd frontend/react-app

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install
```

Create a local environment file:

```
# Create a new file named .env.local and add the following line:
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000/api
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Application

You will need to run the frontend and backend servers in two separate terminals.

**Terminal 1 (Backend):**

```bash
cd backend
php artisan serve
```

The backend API will be running at `http://localhost:8000`.

**Terminal 2 (Frontend):**

```bash
cd frontend/react-app
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be running at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

## Default Login Credentials

After seeding the database, you can log in with the following default admin account:

* **Email:** [admin@digitalleap.africa](mailto:admin@digitalleap.africa)
* **Password:** password

## ü§ù Contributing

1. Create a new feature branch from the `develop` branch (e.g., `git checkout -b feat/user-profile`).
2. Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive messages following conventional commit standards.
3. Push your branch to the repository and open a Pull Request (PR) against `develop`.
4. All PRs require at least one review before they can be merged.
